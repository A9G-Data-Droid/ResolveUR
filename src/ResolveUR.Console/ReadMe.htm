<h2>ResolveUR - Resolve Unused References</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Update 8/1/2014: Visual studio extension is published at <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/fe96c042-9a83-4fa2-921d-6b09aa044315">Visual Studio Gallery</a>
</p>
<p>
Resolves project references for a Visual Studio Solution by <b>removing unused references</b> in each project of the solution.
</p>
<p>
This is done by removing a reference in a project, building project for errors and restoring removed reference if there were build errors.
</p>
<p>
Tested for few project types including console, windows, unit test and website project types.
</p>
<p>
Checks for MSBuild on local system in predetermined paths specified in app.config. As second argument, platform to build against can be specified.
</p>

<h3>Usage at commandline</h3>
<p>
With just path, looks for x64 .net v4.0 msbuild, then x64 v3.5, x64 v2.0, x86 v4.0, x86 v3.5, x86 v2.0
Note: Path or platform arguments are without brackets
<code>
ResolveUR.exe [Path of solution file]
</code>
With platform also specified, x86 for example looks only x86 .net msbuild versions, highest first
<code>
ResolveUR.exe [Path of solution file] [platform]
</code>
</p>
